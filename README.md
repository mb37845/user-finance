## User finance learning project

Description: Create a console application that allows users to manage their personal finances by tracking their income and expenses, and generating financial reports.

Requirements:

    User Management
        Implement user registration and login functionality.
        Securely store user credentials.

    Income Management
        Allow users to add, view, and delete income entries.
        Each income entry should include the date, amount, source (e.g., salary, freelance), and a description.
        Categorize income sources and allow users to filter by category.

    Expense Management
        Allow users to add, view, and delete expense entries.
        Each expense entry should include the date, amount, category (e.g., groceries, rent), and a description.
        Categorize expenses and allow users to filter by category.

    Reports
        Generate reports that summarize income and expenses over a specified period (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually).
        Display total income, total expenses, and net savings for the selected period.
        Provide a breakdown of income and expenses by category.

    Data Persistence
        Store user data, income entries, and expense entries in files.
        Load data when the application starts.

    User Input Validation
        Validate user inputs for correctness and completeness.
        Provide meaningful error messages for invalid inputs.

    Basic Data Structures
        Use lists or dictionaries to manage collections of income and expense entries.
